## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to create a **Lollipop Chart** using **D3.js**. A lollipop chart is a variation of a bar chart where a line connects each data point to the axis, 
creating a visual representation similar to a lollipop. It is especially useful for showing comparisons between categories in a clear, aesthetically pleasing way.

The project is designed to provide an interactive way to explore categorical data and their associated values. 
Users can hover over the chart to get more detailed information about individual data points, making it more engaging and informative.

## Technologies Used
- **D3.js**: A JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers.
- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the page.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the visualizations and the webpage layout.
- **JavaScript**: For integrating D3.js and implementing the interactive aspects of the lollipop chart.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of categorical data with corresponding values. Each data point is represented by a vertical line and a circle at the end of the line. 
The dataset can include any type of categorical data where each category has a numerical value that can be visually compared.
